        <p class="mb-4">Vata, pitta, and kaphaâ€”collectively known as the doshasâ€”are one of the most foundational
            concepts in the tradition of Ayurveda.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl text-green-700 mb-4">The Elements and the Doshas</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">All of the doshas contain all five elements (as do all things in nature), but each is
            predominantly composed of two elements.</p>
        <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x400" alt="Elements & the Doshas" class="mb-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
        <h2 class="text-2xl text-green-700 mb-4">The Doshas and Their Functions</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">Each of the three doshas has a unique personality determined by its particular combination of
            elements and qualities. At the end of the day, each dosha naturally governs specific physiological
            functions:</p>
        <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x400" alt="Elements & the Doshas" class="mb-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
        <h2 class="text-3xl text-green-700 mb-4">Vata</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">Vata embodies the energy of movement and is therefore often associated with wind and the air
            element. Vata is linked to creativity and flexibility; it governs all movementâ€”the flow of the breath, the
            pulsation of the heart, all muscle contractions, tissue movements, cellular mobilityâ€”and communication
            throughout the mind and the nervous system.</p>
        <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x400" alt="Elements & the Doshas" class="mb-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
        <h2 class="text-xl text-green-700 mb-4">Imbalanced Vata</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">When out of balance, vata tends to cause fear, anxiousness, isolation, loneliness, and
            exhaustion. It can lead to both physical and energetic depletion, disrupt proper communication, and cause
            all sorts of abnormal movements in the body such as shakiness or trembling.</p>
        <h2 class="text-3xl text-green-700 mb-4">Pitta</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">Pitta represents the energy of transformation and is therefore closely aligned with the fire
            element. But in living organisms, pitta is largely liquid, which is why water is its secondary element.
            Pitta is neither mobile nor stable, but spreadsâ€”much as the warmth of a fire permeates its surroundings, or
            as water flows in the direction dictated by the terrain.</p>
        <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x400" alt="Elements & the Doshas" class="mb-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
        <p class="mb-4">Pitta is closely related to intelligence, understanding, and the digestion of foods, thoughts,
            emotions, and experiences; it governs nutrition and metabolism, body temperature, and the light of
            understanding.</p>
        <h2 class="text-xl text-green-700 mb-4">Imbalanced Pita</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">When out of balance, pitta causes fiery, reactionary emotions such as frustration, anger,
            jealously, and criticism. Imbalanced pitta is often at the root of heat-related disorders, which can affect
            organs and tissues throughout the body.</p>
        <h2 class="text-3xl text-green-700 mb-4">Kapha</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">Kapha lends structure, solidity, and cohesiveness to all things, and is therefore associated
            primarily with the earth and water elements. Kapha also embodies the watery energies of love and compassion.
            This dosha hydrates all cells and systems, lubricates the joints, moisturizes the skin, maintains immunity,
            and protects the tissues.</p>
        <h2 class="text-xl text-green-700 mb-4">Imbalanced Kapha</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">When out of balance, kapha triggers emotions of attachment, greed, and possessiveness and can
            also create stubbornness, lethargy, and resistance to change. Physically, kapha tends to invite stagnation
            and sluggishness in organs and tissues throughout the bodyâ€”including the mind.</p>
        <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x400" alt="Elements & the Doshas" class="mb-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg">

        <h2 class="text-2xl text-green-700 mb-4 mt-9">Befriending the Doshas in Your Life</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">It is important to remember that we all have innate strengths and gifts, as well as persistent
            challenge areas. The doshas are a wonderful tool for understanding both, and also for recognizing and
            correcting any imbalances at work in our systems.

            Invariably, the doshas shed light on our personal nuances, guide us in improving self-awareness, and can
            help us understand how to offer supportâ€”precisely where and when it matters most. As a result, cultivating a
            relationship with each of the three doshas can have a transformative impact on your overall health and
            well-being. We would love to support you in beginning to befriend the doshas in your life.</p>
